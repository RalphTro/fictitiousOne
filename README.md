# Fictitious One

A repository for the fictitious brand 'Fictitious One' set up for illustration purposes.  

The main purpose consists in demonstrating areas of application and use cases for [GS1 Digital Link](https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-digital-link). The latter is a key enabling standard for bridging the physical and digital world, e.g. to access the digital twin of a given product, asset, location, etc.
